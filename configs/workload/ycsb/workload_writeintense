# Insertion error retry for the core workload.
#
# By default, the YCSB core workload does not retry any operations.
# However, during the load process, if any insertion fails, the entire
# load process is terminated.
# If a user desires to have more robust behavior during this phase, they can
# enable retry for insertion by setting the following property to a positive
# number.
# core_workload_insertion_retry_limit = 0
#
# the following number controls the interval between retries (in seconds):
# core_workload_insertion_retry_interval = 3
